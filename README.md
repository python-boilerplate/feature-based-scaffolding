Feature-based scaffolding: choose your feature and use it in your new projects

---

This template helps you bootstrap Python projects by interactively selecting only the features you need. Instead of cloning a bloated repo, just run `apply.py` and choose features in a simple menu. The result is a clean, customized project structure with only the components you want â€” no more unnecessary code.
